\description{
\code{sensi_plot.sensiTree_Influ} Plot results from \code{tree_influ_phylm} and 
\code{tree_influ_phyglm}
}
\details{
For 'x' from sensiTree_Influ_phylm or sensiTree_Influ_phyglm:

\strong{Graph 1:} Most common influential species on model estimates.
 Percentage of iterations (n.tree or n.intra) where the removal of individual
  species caused significant change in model estimate (sDIFestimate > cutoff). 

\strong{Graph 2:} Shift on model estimate after species removal for most influential
 species. Small red dots represent individual reruns between different trees or 
 simulations while large red dots represent the average DIFestimate among all 
 iterations.
