\title{Sensitivity Analysis for Comparative Methods}
\description{
The functions implemented in \bold{sensiPhy} provide diagnostics for phylogenetic 
generalized least squares by various simulations methods: data removal, 
leave-one-out deletion, random sampling of phylogenies and data. 
A graphical output with several plots for model diagnostic is provided 
for each function in the package.
